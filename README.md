# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using `FlatList` in React Native with large datasets and complex item components. Rapid scrolling can lead to rendering glitches, including blank spaces or incorrect item displays. The `bug.js` file reproduces the problem, while `bugSolution.js` offers a solution.

## Problem

The problem stems from `FlatList`'s optimization techniques (item recycling) conflicting with computationally expensive item rendering.  When scrolling quickly, the component struggles to keep up, resulting in visual inconsistencies.

## Solution

The solution focuses on optimizing the rendering process of individual list items. This includes using techniques like `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and potentially optimizing the item components themselves to reduce rendering overhead.  The `bugSolution.js` file shows these optimizations implemented.

## Setup

Clone the repository and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies. Then, run the project using your preferred React Native method.
