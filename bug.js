This React Native bug arises when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  The issue is that when rapidly scrolling, some items fail to render or render incorrectly, resulting in blank spaces or visual glitches. This happens because FlatList's optimization strategies (like item recycling) clash with heavy item rendering and cause inconsistencies.
